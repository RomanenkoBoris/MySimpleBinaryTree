# MySimpleBinaryTree 
My mind works in such a way that I can't calm down and move on to studying new topics until I have thoroughly analyzed the current one. Thatâ€™s why I decided to write my own slightly simplified but fully functional implementation of a binary tree. 
This approach helps me get acquainted with the world of Java Collections.
This project can be useful for those who are taking their first steps in learning programming and have reached such an extensive topic.
